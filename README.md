<h1>Description:</h1>
<p>In our Pizza app, We customize pizza according to customer specifications and also record the previous orders as history orders. In addition to, we provide option for customer select topings such as Pepperoni, Bacon, Mushrooms, Tomatoes, Capsicum, etc. Moving towards, ordering section in which user need to fill some personal details like Name, Address, City, Zipcode. </p>


<h1>Data storage Consideration:</h1>
<p>Biggest struggle for was to persist the data. We considered several options as follow</br>

internal SQLite db(https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/sqlite)</br>
firebase firestore (https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore )</br>
 GSON solution (https://github.com/google/gson) </br>
 At the end, after researching on each option, we went with GSON which helps serialization/deserialization and using
sharedPreferences for data persistance.</p>
